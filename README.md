# URL - Shortener

Based of the popular web tools such as tinyurl and goo.gle, I decided to create a url shortener using Flask and React.js.

## How do I use it?

As of (14th Jun, 2021), I'm still working on creating a production build for the same. However, you can still test out this application using localhost. 

- Clone the repository onto your local desktop. 
- Set up two terminal windows
- Run the following two commands depending on your package installer. 
  - `npm run start` / `yarn run start`
  - `npm run start-api` / `yarn run start-api`

**Note: Please make sure you download all the appropriate dependencies*

## What technologies?
  
- React.js / Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Flask (MongoEngine)
- MongoDB (NoSQL Database)
